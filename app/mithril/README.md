Storybook for Mithril is a UI development environment for your Mithril components.
With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

![Storybook Screenshot](docs/demo.gif)

Storybook runs outside of your app.
So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm i -g @storybook/cli
cd my-mithril-app
getstorybook
```

Storybook also comes with a lot of [addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/introduction) and a great API to customize as you wish.
You can also build a [static version](https://storybook.js.org/basics/exporting-storybook) of your storybook and deploy it anywhere you want.
